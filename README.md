### In your README.md, please add a short paragraph answering the question: How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

Graceful degradation is a design principle in which a web app has full functionality with modern features. It still functions properly and is still accessible even if some of the new features are disabled or unsupported.
Service workers are browser background scripts that provide functionality like offline support, background sync, and caching. They are required for PWAs and require HTTPS and modern browser support.
These two ideas are related in that graceful degradation is a strategy that determine how parts of web dev function, like service workers which can be used to enhance the user experience of a web app.
